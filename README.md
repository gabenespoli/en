These MATLAB scripts were used for a project measuring neural entrainment using EEG. The `task` folder is for presenting stimuli on a Windows computer, and was used to send port codes to a BioSemi EEG recording system. The `analysis` folder is a combination of wrapper scripts for [EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php) (mostly for preprocessing), and custom functions for selecting independent components by location and measuring entrainment.
